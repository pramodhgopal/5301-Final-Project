# Final project for DTSA 5301 - Data Science as a Field (U. Colorado Boulder)


This document contains a brief analysis of the data from the NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic) from the catalog.data.gov website. 
The intention is to provide an exploratory data analysis in a reproducible manner to ensure the validity of said analysis.


The analysis was done in RStudio and the resulting Rmd file was saved to this repository.

### The rmd document is meant to be used in RStudio to reproduce my findings from this data set.

Also included the powerpoint presentation for reference
